Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far our group has constructed the base game with a working upgrade system. We've added a multiplier for the clicks, an autoclicker, and an easter egg button. The project so far has come along very well, and is even presentable now.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

The project generally needs to be more polished because of certain lag or glitch issues. We have yet to add sound, a more complex upgrade system, and also we need to tweak the auto-clicker in a way that doesn't mess with the multipliers for the clickers.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

My group had to get rid of a feature after I asked for help from our section TA. The feature was generally supposed to have an image as the cursor, so I came up with the solution of making another turtle infinity loop to just follow the cursor. The program worked it just wouldn't have run because of our infinite while loop that moves the owl. Our TA explained to me that we cannot have both infinite loops running at the same time so my group just decided to get rid of the feature totally.
