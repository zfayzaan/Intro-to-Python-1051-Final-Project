# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Temple Owl Clicker

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Our project will consist of a game similar to the popular browser game cookie clicker, where an object will count the number of clicks done by the user, which then can be used to buy auto-generated upgrades, to create more clicks. In leiu of a cookie we will have Hooter the owl.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our software will use an accumlator loop in order to collect the amount of clicks that the user has done. From there the clicks will be stored in a dictionary in order to easily substract and add to this click bank. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

We will have the user be able to click the owl and gain score. The score will be used to buy upgrades. Upgrades can change owl speed, owl size or amount of score per click. Have sound effects for clicks and upgrades.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We will be able to create a better graphical interface. Will have polished start screen and will be able to save the game and return later to continue a game. Save info could be saved in a csv file and could be read during game start so that games can continued.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The game will work flawlessly and we will have many levels of upgrades. Add boss levels that will either give you a lot of score or will take points away from you based on if you are able to defeat the boss or not. Clicking on the boss fast enough will decrease the health of the boss.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
