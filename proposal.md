# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Temple Owl Clicker

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Our project will consist of a game similar to the popular browser game cookie clicker, where an object will count the number of clicks done by the user, which then can be used to buy auto-generated upgrades, to create more clicks. In leiu of a cookie we will have Hooter the owl.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our software will use an accumlator loop in order to collect the amount of clicks that the user has done. From there the clicks will be stored in a dictionary in order to easily substract and add to this click bank. We would like to create the game with turtle, and my group will generally be using the IDLE and Vscode software to write out our code. The code will be executed utilizing the turtle, random, and possibly any other methods we find while researching how we can do the tasks we want to do. So far my group has discussed some features such as an upgrade system to increase the amount of clicks, a random path for the owl image to simulate a flying owl, and make the owl become bigger as it's clicked more. The whole point of the game as of right now is to feed the owl, and the upgrade system is just different places to eat on campus with each place having a different value of clicks. I feel as though resetting the owl size could be a challenge but mostly executed through the use of turtle.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

We will have the user be able to click the owl and gain score. The score will be used to buy upgrades. Upgrades can change owl speed, owl size or amount of score per click. Have sound effects for clicks and upgrades.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We will be able to create a better graphical interface. Will have polished start screen and will be able to save the game and return later to continue a game. Save info could be saved in a csv file and could be read during game start so that games can continued. Using turtle image and screen to create a random path for the owl to travel along. A system that is able to subtract and add to the csv file containing the amount of clicks, and then an upgrade system to generate auto-clicks.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The game will work flawlessly and we will have many levels of upgrades. Add boss levels that will either give you a lot of score or will take points away from you based on if you are able to defeat the boss or not. Clicking on the boss fast enough will decrease the health of the boss.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Some new skills we will need to acquire is the ability to quickly research new methods in python and how they can be implemented into our code. I am thinking we may need to do a lot of research as a group to see the full capability of the turtle methods. We will have to learn how to store data so that we can create saved games and allow users to continue where they left off. I believe our group will try to all work together on the base game and then split up developing the features, but we haven't decided the specifics and that may change later due to any problems coming or changes in our process of working out the code.
