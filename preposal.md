# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Side-scroller game. RPG elements such as swords, armor, lives.
Cookie-clicker type game. Will be something other than cookies.
Space-invaders with weapon and armor upgrades, maybe harder boss enemies

All games will have upgrades and sprites. Side-scoller and space-invaders will have increased level of difficulty as you progress

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I plan to work with Noel Chacko and Shyqyri Dogjani

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Is there a certain length we have to hit?
