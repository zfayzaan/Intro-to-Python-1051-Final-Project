# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

1.Side-scroller game. RPG elements such as swords, armor, lives.

2.Cookie-clicker type game. Will be something other than cookies.

3.Space-invaders with weapon and armor upgrades, maybe harder boss enemies

4. Banner ad advertising your class, would be using python html and css with the help of Google web design.

All games will have upgrades and sprites. Side-scoller and space-invaders will have increased level of difficulty as you progress


## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I plan to work with Noel Chacko and Shyqyri Dogjani

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Is there a certain length we have to hit?
