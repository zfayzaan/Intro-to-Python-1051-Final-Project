Difficulties Overcome and what we learned:
For a feature on our project we wanted an image to continuously follow the mouse but we needed an infinite loop to get done this task. To receive help I went to a lab TA who taught me that we cannot have more than 1 infinite loop in our code, or else one will keep running while the other is never touched.
Another difficulty that we had to overcome is the importing of different modules and seeing if they were compatible with each other. A lot of testing and debugging was done to see if we could import a window while using a different module to do something else on the given window. This proved challenging specifically with pygame, tkinter, and turtle. Pygame for us seemed too difficult to learn considering we hadn’t gone over it in class, therefore we stuck to the tkinter and turtle modules and tried to keep our code as simple as possible. We learned from tkinter that it is primarily a “window creator” module, and it mainly allowed us to make our user interface convenient and fast.
Another feature we meant to put into the project but realized we had to remove was sound when the owl was clicked. Our group was able to implement this feature fully but an optimization issue arose from implementing the feature. As we playtested we realized that the sound caused the owl to stop moving and overall lag issues started popping up. 

What we enjoyed:
We enjoyed working together to make a game that is fun to mess around with for a little. It is extremely cool to know that we made this game from scratch. During parts of this project we ran into issues of how to implement features, in this I enjoyed being able to research foreign modules such as the tkinter module which helped us not only get the features we wanted but go above said feature. It's pretty obvious that our group mostly used turtle windows for the game, which allowed us to learn new methods of the turtle module, and this is how we were able to find out we can make buttons through turtle. 
Our group also enjoyed generally messing around with turtles because it really shows the capabilities of such a module in creative hands. We were unsure how we were going to implement many of the features that we had envisioned. But we were able to figure most of the things out and come out with a product that works and is fun to play. It was amazing to see all the things we learned this semester come together with the new skills we learned throughout this process to create a finished product that runs and works. To be able to proudly show our friends this game and to see them have a little fun while playing is amazing.
